Assign hexadecimal value to variable.
Do swapping of LSB and MSB bit.
First set lsb bit by anding operation and store in one variable. 
Then similarly set msb bit and store in another variable.
And do right shift and left shift operation for swapping. 
Then add both shifting result and store in one variable we get swapped value.
