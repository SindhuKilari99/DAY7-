 Assign the input number to variable x
 Do bitwise operation x with 0xAAAAAAAA so we get all even bit, The number 0xAAAAAAAA is for 32 bit number with all even bits set as 1 and all odd bits as 0. 
 Do bitwise operation x with 0x55555555so we get all odd bit , The number 0x55555555 is for 32 bit number with all odd bits set as 1 and all even bits as 0. 
 Right shift all even bits. 
 Left shift all odd bits. 
 Use logiacal OR opeartion to add both even and odd bits and return. *
